        		<h1>About me</h1>
				
				<p>I am a first-year Physics PhD student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Connecticut. I got my undergraduate degree from Michigan State, where I was also a post-baccalaureate researcher for a year. My research interests are: X-ray binaries, stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis, and galactic chemical evolution.
				   My passions include science communication and data visualization. My personal interests include watercolor painting, astrophotography, and baking French pastries. I would also like to get my master's degree in social work, one day.
				</p>
			
			<p>I'm also passionate about social justice, fighting for equity, and using the privilege I have as a white woman to support underrepresented and under-resourced students in the field of astronomy. This means the creation of resources, mentorship programs, and research and funding opportunities for these students while also addressing
				the systemic issues that they face both in academia and in society.
			  </p>
