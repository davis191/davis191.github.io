        		<h1>About me</h1>
				
				<p>Hiya! I'm Meg, a queer, non-binary scientist! I am a fourth-year Physics PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Connecticut (UConn). I got my undergraduate degree from Michigan State, where I was also a post-baccalaureate researcher for a year. My research interests are: X-ray binaries, galactic chemical evolution, supermassive black hole binaries, and quasar variability.
				   I especially enjoy researching objects, like quasars, that are hypervariable (the weirder/more variable, the better)! My passions include science communication, data visualization, and open-source software development. My personal interests include stained glass art, astrophotography, and reading. I would also like to get my master's degree in social work, one day.
				</p>
			
			<p>I'm passionate about social justice, fighting for equity, and using the privilege I have as a white person to support under-represented and under-resourced students in the field of astronomy. This means the creation of resources, mentorship programs, and research and funding opportunities for these students while also addressing
				the systemic issues that they face both in academia and in society.
			  </p>
